# DesignPattern — Design Patterns in Practice

This repository contains implementations and examples of common **software design patterns** across languages (C, C++, JavaScript, or others you used).  
The goal is to demonstrate practical knowledge of object-oriented design, decoupling, and architecture patterns that improve maintainability, testability, and system design — skills that complement my embedded/firmware background.
